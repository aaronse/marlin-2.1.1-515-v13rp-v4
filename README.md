Snapshot of [V1E MP3DP v4](https://forum.v1e.com/t/repeat-v2/33330) flavor of Marlin 2.1.1 515 source code.  Downloaded/copied from https://docs.v1e.com/electronics/marlin-firmware/#skr-pro-configurations_1

firmware and source code Snapshot in initial commit was compiled for SKR Pro 1.2.  

My plan is to submit edits in this repo that build for the Octopus in my [MP3DP v4](https://forum.v1e.com/t/mp3dp-v4-azas-build/37251) build.
